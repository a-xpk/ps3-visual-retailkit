 ## PS3 Visual Retailkit

A visual overlay for PS3 on CFW and HEN, designed to give your console a lightweight devkit-style HUD.
Originally starting as a simple firmware-label display in v0.02, the project has grown into a functional on-screen info overlay by v0.5b.

 ## Currently Displays (v0.5b)

<text id="system_version">4.92.1.098.59 DEV ★</text>

<text id="system_version_desc">RETAILKIT FOR PS3 ★</text>

Real-time IP address

Real-time FPS counter

IDPS viewer

All elements appear in the upper-left corner, optimized for 1080p / 1080i.

 ## Usage

Copy the overlay XML to your PS3 (example: /dev_hdd0/custom_retailkit.xml).

Load it using a CFW or HEN-compatible plugin like webMAN MOD.

The overlay will show on the XMB and in homebrew that supports drawing overlays.

## Purpose

The goal is simple:
Give your PS3 a clean, cosmetic devkit-inspired look without touching system files.
It does not modify firmware, flash, or system behavior — it's purely visual.

## Version Notes

v0.02 — basic system version text only.

v0.5b — added IP, FPS, IDPS, improved layout, and expanded compatibility.

## License & Disclaimer

This project is for personal, cosmetic use only.
It does not edit /dev_flash, NOR modify actual firmware.
You alone are responsible for how you use it.
