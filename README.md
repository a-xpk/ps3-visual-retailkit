# PS3 Visual Retailkit

A custom visual overlay for PS3 running HFW, CFW, and HEN— designed to give your console a “devkit” look.  

Currently displays:

- `<text id="system_version">4.92.1.098.59 DEV ★</text>`  
- `<text id="system_version_desc">RETAILKIT FOR PS3 ★</text>`  

## Usage

1. Copy the overlay XML to your PS3, e.g. `/dev_hdd0/custom_retailkit.xml`  
2. Load it using a CFW plugin such as **webMAN MOD**  
3. The overlay will appear in the **upper-left corner** of your XMB or in supported homebrew  

## Purpose

The project aims to give your PS3 a **devkit-style visual flair**.  
It is purely cosmetic — no firmware is modified, and it is completely safe on CFW.  

## License & Disclaimer

This overlay is for personal use. It does **not** modify the real firmware stored in `/dev_flash`.  
Use responsibly — do not distribute firmware modifications.
